# Utilities for Unity

This library contains useful scripts for Unity, written or rewritten by me.
This allows you to speed up the development of projects using popular components.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Unity should support .NET 4.6

### Installing

To install and receive timely updates, we recommend that you connect this repository as a submodule to your project.

Example command

```
### Running the tests

For testing and example, the root directory contains Demo.unity.
This scene is updated simultaneously with the scripts.
